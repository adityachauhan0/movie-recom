## About

The **Movie Recommender Website** is a simple and interactive platform that helps users discover new movies. By providing a few details about movies they like, users can receive movie recommendations based on a pre-trained model. The recommender model is built using **machine learning** techniques and the **Pickle** library to store and load the trained model. The app is built with **Streamlit**, a powerful Python framework for creating web apps.

---

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: Enter the name of a movie you like, and get recommendations for similar movies.
- **Streamlit UI**: An interactive and user-friendly web interface to input your movie preferences.
- **Pre-trained Model**: The recommendation system is powered by a machine learning model saved with **Pickle**.
- **Fast and Responsive**: The Streamlit framework provides a fast, live preview of the recommended movies.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Movie Recommender Website locally on your machine.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityachauhan0/movie-recommender-website.git
```

### Install dependencies

1. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd movie-recommender-website
```

2. Install the required Python libraries using **pip**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` should include the necessary dependencies, such as:
- **Streamlit** for building the web interface.
- **Pickle** for loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** or other libraries used for the recommendation system.

Example `requirements.txt`:

```
streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn
pickle-mixin
```

---

## Usage

To run the **Movie Recommender Website** locally:

1. Start the Streamlit app by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. The app should open automatically in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`. You can then start using the recommender system by entering the name of a movie you like.

---

## Building

To build and deploy the website, follow these steps:

1. **Train the Model**: Before deployment, ensure that the model is trained and saved as a Pickle file. If you have a custom model training script, run it to generate the Pickle file.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pickle
     model = train_model()  # Train your model here
     with open('movie_recommender.pkl', 'wb') as file:
         pickle.dump(model, file)
     ```

2. **Deploy the App**: You can deploy the app to platforms like **Heroku**, **Streamlit Sharing**, or any cloud platform that supports Python apps.

---

## Deployment

To deploy the **Movie Recommender Website** on **Streamlit Sharing**:

1. Create a Streamlit account at [Streamlit Sharing](https://share.streamlit.io/).
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Streamlit Sharing.
3. Set the repository’s main branch to deploy the app from.
4. The app will be live at a URL provided by Streamlit Sharing.

Alternatively, you can deploy it on **Heroku** or **AWS**, depending on your preference.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for building the backend and machine learning model.
- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for building interactive web apps quickly and with minimal code.
- **Pickle**: Used for serializing the trained recommendation model and loading it into the app.
- **Pandas**: Used for handling and processing the movie dataset.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model training (if used for training the recommendation model).
